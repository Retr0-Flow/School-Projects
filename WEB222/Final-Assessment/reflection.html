                <h2>Explain the concept of Responsive Design. What does the term mean&quest;</h2>
                <p> Responsive design is an approach taken when designers and developers want to create content 
                    that scales to the user&apos;s method of access. What that means is all content&sol;websites&sol;etc. 
                    is designed in such a way that regardless of what is used to access the website, 
                    whether it be a smartphone, laptop, tv, smartwatch, tablet or even 
                    <a href="https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-mods/2889765-webdisplays-1-0-browse-on-the-internet-in"> 
                    a browser in a video game (yes, really)</a>, the user can view and interact with the content&sol;website as the 
                    designers intended. This means that everything that is loaded into the user&apos;s device is 
                    scaled, accessible, and useable by them on their device. The primary purpose of 
                    Responsive Design is to make content appear consistently across all devices that can 
                    access it.

                <h2>How does responsive design relate to web technologies&quest;</h2>
                <p>
                    Responsive Design relates to web technologies in many ways. One example is the quality of 
                    life it gives for users to resize their browser windows due to limited screen space. 
                    Another is the accessibility it offers to users who browse and interact with our web 
                    resources using non-standard displays&sol;devices. This allows for many new methods of 
                    interaction to spring forth and creates new possibilities for what can be made.

                <h2>What did you learn about building web apps for different devices through your research&quest;</h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot, much more than what can be written here within the length constraints. The 
                    key learnings I can mention are these, firstly web development is a field much vaster than 
                    I could have ever anticipated. From the multitude of libraries to frameworks available that 
                    can accomplish the same task to the versatility of each language (HTML&sol;JS) alone. The 
                    second key learning I will mention is that during my studies I kept running into something 
                    called  ARIA. This is short for Accessible Internet Rich Applications, and it is something 
                    truly great (at least from how I understand it at this moment). When writing HTML for the 
                    various assignments I kept running into tag suggestions for ARIA elements and after enough 
                    occurrences, I finally delved and looked into what it was. ARIA is a great approach to 
                    making the internet and all its applications and services more accessible to those that 
                    need it. In my spare time, I&apos;ll be looking into the uses of ARIA in common pages to see 
                    how widespread its use is. Finally, the most important thing I learned through building 
                    different web apps was that there is no end to the learning of web development, it&apos;s easy 
                    to get overwhelmed with everything available. With the sheer amount of tools already built 
                    the ones being built constantly day by day thanks to the collaboration of web developers 
                    across the world, there is no end to the learning. This means I don&apos;t have to learn 
                    everything and can take my time with no pressure. There will always be more to learn, 
                    so learn what you can that's required for what you need right now.

                <h2>Finally, describe your learning experience in the course.</h2>
                <p>
                    Overall my experience in this course was relatively great. It pushed me to develop better
                     self-learning skills and taught me the patience required to read the 
                     manual&sol;documentation pages for the languages&sol;tools I used. If I have any critique it&apos;s 
                     that I wish there were more labs to practice JS as it&apos;s a very versatile language and 
                     the more exposure we get to it the better.
